Look at the server actions @server-actions unffortinetly i'm not using the normal API's i want all of these server actions to be turned into a normal NextJS Api endpoints at @app/api (except whatever needs to be a server action or makes sense to be one) which then will be used by @libs/api to use axios to fetch which then those functions from @libs/api will be used as the fetch functions when using tanstack query with useQuery or useMutation, i want you then to replace these server actions with the useQuery and useMutations and not use them on my NextJS code.
